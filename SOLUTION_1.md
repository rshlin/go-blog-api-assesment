# logical test solution

The function `NumDecodings` is a Go implementation of a dynamic programming solution that calculates the number of ways a numeric string can be decoded into its original message, given a specific mapping of letters to numbers ('A' to 'Z' mapped to 1 to 26).

## Function Signature

```go
func NumDecodings(s string) int
```

## Parameters

The function takes one parameter:

- `s`: a string of digits. This string represents the encoded message we want to decode.

## Return Value

The function returns an integer, representing the number of possible decodings of the input string `s`.

## Error Handling

The function checks if the input string contains only digits. If it encounters a non-digit character, it will log a fatal error.

## Algorithm and Implementation

The function uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It creates an array `dp` of size `n+1` where `n` is the length of the string `s`. Each element in `dp` represents the number of ways the corresponding prefix of `s` can be decoded.

The `dp` array is initialized as follows:
- `dp[0]` is set to 1 because an empty string can be decoded in one way.
- `dp[1]` is set to 0 if the first character of `s` is '0' (since '0' does not correspond to any letter), and 1 otherwise.

Then, for each character in `s` from the second character onwards, the function does the following:
- If the current character is not '0', it adds the number of ways the previous prefix can be decoded to `dp[i]`.
- If the previous character is '1' or the previous character is '2' and the current character is less than or equal to '6', it adds the number of ways the prefix ending two characters ago can be decoded to `dp[i]`.

Finally, the function returns `dp[n]`, which represents the total number of ways the entire string `s` can be decoded.

## Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because the function iterates over the string `s` once.

The space complexity of the function is also O(n), due to the `dp` array which has a size of `n+1`.
